 The Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) is a powerful and flexible framework designed for social engineering. It provides various modules to perform different types of attacks, such as phishing, pretexting, and more. Below are some common features and their examples within the SET environment, run from a Kali Linux terminal.

### Basic Commands
Before diving into specific commands, ensure you have SET installed. You can install it using:
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install set
```
To start SET, simply type:
```bash
setoolkit
```
This will open the SET menu interface. From here, you can select different modules and options to perform various attacks.

### 1. Phishing Menu
The phishing module allows you to create and launch phishing attacks. Hereâ€™s how you might use it:
- **Create a new phishing attack**:
  ```bash
  setoolkit -m phishing
  ```
  This will present you with several options for creating your phishing campaign, such as choosing between social engineering attacks or website cloning.

### 2. Pretexting Menu
The pretexting module helps in setting up scenarios to gain trust from the target:
- **Set up a fake Facebook login page**:
  ```bash
  setoolkit -m pretexting --phish facebook
  ```
  This will guide you through creating a fake Facebook login page that can be used to capture credentials.

### 3. Mask Phishing Menu
The mask phishing module allows for more customization and stealth in your phishing attacks:
- **Create a custom phishing kit**:
  ```bash
  setoolkit -m maskphish --create-profile
  ```
  You will be prompted to fill out details about the target, such as the URL and name of the site. This creates a fully customized phishing page.

### 4. Web Menu
The web module allows you to launch various social engineering attacks via websites:
- **Set up a fake Adobe update page**:
  ```bash
  setoolkit -m web --phish adobe
  ```
  Similar to the pretexting option, this will guide you through setting up a convincing fake Adobe login page.

### 5. Smtp Menu
The SMTP module can be used to send phishing emails:
- **Send a test phishing email**:
  ```bash
  setoolkit -m smtp --server smtp.gmail.com --port 587 --email your_email@example.com --password 'your_password'
  ```
  You will need to configure the SMTP server settings and provide valid credentials for a Gmail account to send emails.

### 6. Social-Engineer Menu
The social-engineer module provides various social engineering techniques:
- **Pretexting**:
  ```bash
  setoolkit -m social-engineer --pretext "I am from Microsoft and need access to your system"
  ```
  This will simulate a scenario where you pretend to be from Microsoft, asking for administrative credentials.

### 7. Cam Menu
The cam module can capture video from the webcam:
- **Start capturing video**:
  ```bash
  setoolkit -m cam --start
  ```
  This will start recording video through the webcam connected to your Kali Linux machine.

### Conclusion
These examples cover some of the basic and advanced functionalities provided by the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) in Kali Linux. SET is a versatile tool that can be used for various social engineering attacks, but it should be used ethically and legally, with permission from all parties involved. Always ensure you have proper authorization before conducting any social engineering attack.
