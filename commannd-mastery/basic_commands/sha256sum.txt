 The `sha256sum` command is a utility used to compute and verify SHA-256 cryptographic checksums. It is commonly found on Unix-like operating systems, including Kali Linux. Below are some key features of the `sha256sum` command along with examples to illustrate each feature:

### 1. Computing Checksum
You can use `sha256sum` to compute and display the SHA-256 checksum of a file.

**Example:**
```sh
sha256sum filename
```
For example, if you have a file named `example.txt`, you would run:
```sh
sha256sum example.txt
```
This will output the SHA-256 checksum of `example.txt`.

### 2. Verifying Checksum
You can use `sha256sum` to verify that a file's checksum matches a previously known good checksum.

**Example:**
```sh
sha256sum -c checksum_file
```
Where `checksum_file` contains the checksums you want to compare against, typically in the format:
```
<checksum>  <filename>
```
For example:
```sh
echo 'e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855  example.txt' > checksum_file
sha256sum -c checksum_file
```
This will verify that the SHA-256 checksum of `example.txt` matches the provided checksum in `checksum_file`.

### 3. Checking Multiple Files
You can compute and check multiple files at once by providing filenames directly or using wildcards.

**Example:**
```sh
sha256sum file1 file2 file3
```
For example:
```sh
sha256sum example1.txt example2.txt
```
Or with wildcards:
```sh
sha256sum *.txt
```

### 4. Using Wildcards and Piping
You can use wildcards to process multiple files and even pipe the output of other commands into `sha256sum`.

**Example:**
```sh
sha256sum /path/to/directory/*
```
Or with piping:
```sh
find /path/to/files -type f | xargs sha256sum
```
This will compute the SHA-256 checksum for all files in the specified directory.

### 5. Generating Checksum File
You can generate a file containing checksums for multiple files:

**Example:**
```sh
sha256sum * > checksums_file.txt
```
This will create `checksums_file.txt` with SHA-256 checksums of all files in the current directory.

### 6. Verifying Multiple Checksums
You can verify multiple checksum entries at once:

**Example:**
```sh
echo 'e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855  example.txt
another_checksum   another_file' > checksums_to_verify.txt
sha256sum -c checksums_to_verify.txt
```
This will verify the checksums listed in `checksums_to_verify.txt`.

### Summary
The `sha256sum` command is a powerful tool for verifying and computing SHA-256 checksums on files, offering flexibility through various options, wildcards, and piping capabilities.
