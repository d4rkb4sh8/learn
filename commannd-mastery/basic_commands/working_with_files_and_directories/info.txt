 The `info` command in Kali Linux is used to display detailed information about various commands, functions, and other topics. It provides a comprehensive documentation format that includes hyperlinks for easy navigation between different sections. Here are some key features and examples of using the `info` command:

1. **Basic Usage**:
   - To view info pages for specific commands or topics, you can use the following syntax:
     ```sh
     info <command>
     ```
   Example:
     ```sh
     info ifconfig
     ```

2. **Navigation**:
   - In the `info` interface, you can navigate using the arrow keys and press 'Q' to quit. The page will display a menu at the bottom where you can jump to different sections or related topics.

3. **Sections**:
   - Each info page is divided into several sections (nodes), which are linked together in a tree structure. You can navigate these sections using numbers, letters, and other keys provided on the screen.

4. **Searching**:
   - To search within an info page, press 's' to enter a search mode. Type your query and press Enter. The matching parts of the text will be highlighted.

5. **Contents List**:
   - At any point in the `info` session, you can press 'h' to display a list of all sections (nodes) available on that page. This helps in quickly jumping to specific topics without navigating through the entire tree structure.

6. **Example Command Info Page**:
   ```sh
   info ifconfig
   ```
   - This will show detailed information about the `ifconfig` command, including options, descriptions, and examples of usage.

7. **Customizing Info Display**:
   - You can configure how `info` displays text by setting environment variables like `INFO_MODE`, `PAGER`, or `TERM`. For example:
     ```sh
     export INFO_MODE=less
     ```
   - This will make `info` use `less` as the pager instead of the default more.

8. **Using Info with Man Pages**:
   - If you prefer using man pages over info pages, you can configure your system to open them directly:
     ```sh
     export PAGER=/usr/bin/man
     ```

9. **Example of Navigating an Info Page**:
   - After running `info ifconfig`, press 'n' to go to the next section or 'p' to go back. You can also use numbers (e.g., 2 for the second section) or search within the current node by pressing 's'.

10. **Example of Searching in Info**:
    - In `info ifconfig`, press 's', then type "ip", and you will see sections related to IP addresses highlighted in the text, indicating matches.

These features provide a powerful way to explore and understand various aspects of Kali Linux through its command-line interface using the `info` command.
