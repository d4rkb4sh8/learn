 The `chsh` (change shell) command in Kali Linux is used to change the default login shell for a user. Here are some features and examples of using the `chsh` command in the Kali Linux terminal:

### Features
1. **Change Default Shell**: You can change the default shell for a user account to any supported shell installed on your system.
2. **List Available Shells**: The `chsh` command will list all available shells that you can switch to.
3. **Interactive Mode**: If no arguments are provided, `chsh` will prompt you to select a new shell from the list of available shells.

### Examples

#### Example 1: List Available Shells
To see a list of all available shells on your system that you can switch to, use the following command:
```bash
chsh -l
```
**Output**:
```
/bin/sh
/bin/bash
/usr/sbin/nologin
...
```

#### Example 2: Change Shell for a User
To change the default shell for a specific user, you need superuser privileges. For example, to change the shell for the user `kali` to `zsh`, use the following command:
```bash
sudo chsh -s /bin/zsh kali
```
**Output**:
```
Changing shell for kali to /bin/zsh
Password:  # Enter the superuser password
Shell successfully changed to /bin/zsh.
```

#### Example 3: Interactive Mode
If you run `chsh` without any arguments, it will prompt you to select a new shell from the list of available shells:
```bash
chsh
```
**Output**:
```
Changing default shell for kali
Selecting a new shell
1) /bin/sh
2) /bin/bash
3) /usr/sbin/nologin
... (other shells listed here)
# Enter the number corresponding to your choice, e.g., 2
```
You will be prompted to enter the number corresponding to the desired shell, and then you will need to confirm with your password if required by your system configuration.

### Additional Notes
- **Supported Shells**: The exact list of supported shells can vary depending on your Kali Linux distribution and installed packages. Common examples include `/bin/bash`, `/bin/sh`, `/usr/bin/fish`, and others.
- **Root Privileges**: Most distributions require superuser privileges to change the default shell for other users, as it involves modifying user account settings.

By using these examples and features, you can effectively manage and customize the shells used by different user accounts on your Kali Linux system.
