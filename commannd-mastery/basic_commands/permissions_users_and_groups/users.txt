 The "users" command in Kali Linux is used to display information about who is currently logged into the system. It can be particularly useful for security audits and monitoring user activity. Here are some features along with examples of how to use the "users" command in the Kali Linux terminal:

### Basic Usage
The basic usage of the "users" command is straightforward:
```bash
users
```
This will display a list of users currently logged into the system, separated by commas. For example:
```bash
$ users
john, jane, david
```

### Display User Information
You can use options to display additional information about each user:
- `-u` or `--user`: This option shows only the usernames of logged-in users.
- `-s` or `--short`: This option is equivalent to "-u" and also displays only the usernames.
```bash
users -u
```
This will output:
```bash
john jane david
```

### Display UID Information
To display information about the user IDs (UIDs) of logged-in users, you can use the `-b` or `--busdays` option:
```bash
users -b
```
For example, it might output something like:
```bash
1001 1002 1003
```
This indicates that John has a UID of 1001, Jane has a UID of 1002, and David has a UID of 1003.

### Display GID Information
To show the group IDs (GIDs) of logged-in users, use the `-g` or `--groups` option:
```bash
users -g
```
This will output something like:
```bash
1001 1002 1003
```
Indicating that John is in group 1001, Jane is in group 1002, and David is in group 1003.

### Display Real Name Information
To display the real names of logged-in users (if available), use the `-r` or `--realnames` option:
```bash
users -r
```
For example, it might output something like:
```bash
John Doe, Jane Smith, David Brown
```
This is useful for identifying who each user is based on their real names.

### Combining Options
You can combine multiple options to get more detailed information:
```bash
users -u -g -r
```
This will output a combination of usernames and group IDs alongside real names:
```bash
john 1001 John Doe, jane 1002 Jane Smith, david 1003 David Brown
```

### Real-time Updates
To see the list of users updated in real time, you can use the `watch` command along with "users":
```bash
watch -n 5 users
```
This will refresh every 5 seconds and display the current logged-in users.

By using these options and examples, you can effectively monitor user activity on a Kali Linux system through the terminal using the "users" command.
