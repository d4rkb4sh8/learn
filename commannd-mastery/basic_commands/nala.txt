 Nala is a Python-based package manager for Debian-based systems that aims to be a more user-friendly and faster alternative to APT. It was created as an alternative to ADPGP, which is known for its slow performance and complexity. Here are some of the key features and examples of how you can use the `nala` command in Kali Linux:

### Key Features
1. **Faster Package Management**: Nala uses multi-threading to speed up package installations, updates, and removals compared to APT.

3. **Search Functionality**: You can search for packages using `nala search <package_name>`.
4. **Installation Examples**: Hereâ€™s how you can install, update, and remove packages using Nala:

### Installation and Setup
If you haven't installed Nala yet on Kali Linux, you can do so by adding the PPA and updating your package list:
