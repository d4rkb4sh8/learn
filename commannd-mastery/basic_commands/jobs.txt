 The `jobs` command in Kali Linux is used to list all currently running background jobs. It displays a list of job numbers, their status (running or stopped), and the command being executed. Here are some key features and examples of using the `jobs` command in the Kali Linux terminal:

### Key Features:
1. **List Running Jobs**: Displays a list of all currently running background jobs.
2. **Job Numbers**: Each job is assigned a unique number, starting from 1.
3. **Status Indicators**: Shows whether each job is running (`+`) or stopped (`-`).
4. **Command Execution**: Indicates the command being executed for each job.

### Examples:

#### Example 1: Running a Command in the Background
```sh
root@kali:~# sleep 60 &
[1] 2345
root@kali:~# jobs
[1]+ Running        sleep 60 &
```
In this example, `sleep 60` is running as a background job with job number 1. The `+` indicates that it is the currently active job.

#### Example 2: Stopping a Job
To stop a running job, you can use the `kill` command followed by the job number. For example, to kill the job with job number 1:
```sh
root@kali:~# kill %1
[1]+ Stopped        sleep 60
```
Here, the `%1` refers to the first job in the list, and it has been stopped using the `kill` command.

#### Example 3: Continuing a Stopped Job
If you have a stopped job and want to continue its execution, you can use the `fg` or `bg` commands. For example, to bring the stopped job with job number 1 back to the foreground:
```sh
root@kali:~# fg %1
sleep 60
```
Alternatively, to run a stopped job in the background:
```sh
root@kali:~# bg %1
[1]+ sleep 60 &
```

#### Example 4: Listing All Jobs with Status
To see all running and stopped jobs at once, you can simply use the `jobs` command without any additional arguments:
```sh
root@kali:~# jobs
[1]+ Running        sleep 60 &
[2]- Stopped        some_other_command &
```
Here, job number 1 is running (`+`), and job number 2 is stopped (`-`).

#### Example 5: Bringing a Job to the Foreground
To bring a specific job (e.g., job number 1) to the foreground for interactive use:
```sh
root@kali:~# fg %1
sleep 60
```
This will give you an interactive shell where you can control the execution of the command directly.

### Summary
The `jobs` command in Kali Linux is a useful tool for managing background jobs, including checking their status and controlling them interactively. The examples above cover running commands in the background, stopping/continuing jobs, and bringing jobs to the foreground or background as needed.
