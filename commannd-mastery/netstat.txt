 The `netstat` command in Linux is a powerful tool used to display network-related information, such as active connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade rules, and multicast memberships. Here are some of its key features along with examples:

### 1. Display Active Internet Connections
The most common use of `netstat` is to show the current TCP and UDP connections on a system.
```sh
netstat -tuln
```
This command will display:
- **-t**: Show only TCP ports.
- **-u**: Show only UDP ports.
- **-l**: Display only listening ports.
- **-n**: Show numerical addresses instead of trying to resolve hostnames.

Example output:
```
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name    
tcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN      1357/sshd           
tcp6       0      0 ::1:631                 :::*                    LISTEN      487/cupsd           
udp        0      0 192.168.1.100:53         0.0.0.0:*                           78/systemd-resolve 
udp        0      0 192.168.1.100:123         0.0.0.0:*                           487/cupsd           
```

### 2. Display Network Connections by Program
You can also use `netstat` to find out which program is using a specific port.
```sh
netstat -tuln | grep <port_number>
```
Example: To check if the HTTP server (port 80) is running:
```sh
netstat -tuln | grep 80
```

### 3. Display IPv6 Connections
If your system supports IPv6, `netstat` can display information about IPv6 connections.
```sh
netstat -t6uln
```
This command will show both IPv4 and IPv6 connections if they are active on the system.

### 4. Display Routing Table
The routing table shows how data packets are directed from one network interface to another through various networks until they reach their destination.
```sh
netstat -r
```
Example output:
```
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
default         192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0
192.168.1.0     *               255.255.255.0   UG    0      0        0 eth0
```

### 5. Display Network Interface Statistics
This can give you detailed statistics about network interfaces, including bytes sent and received, errors, dropped packets, etc.
```sh
netstat -i
```
Example output:
```
Kernel Interface table
Iface      MTU    RX-OK   RX-ERR   RX-DRP   RX-OVR    TX-OK   TX-ERR   TX-DRP   TX-OVR   Coll
eth0       1500    123456  12      34       56        7890    0       0       0       0
lo         65536   123456  0       0        0         123456 0       0       0       0
```

### 6. Display Masquerade Rules (for iptables)
If you are using `iptables` for NAT, `netstat` can display the masquerading rules.
```sh
netstat -tuln | grep :masq
```
This is useful if you need to check your IP masquerading settings.

### 7. Display Multicast Membership
Multicast groups that a host has joined can be displayed using `netstat`.
```sh
netstat -g
```
Example output:
```
IPv4 Multicast Memberships
Interface       Group
eth0            224.0.0.1
lo              224.0.0.2
```

### Summary
`netstat` is a versatile command that provides detailed information about network configurations and connections on Linux systems, making it an essential tool for troubleshooting and understanding the network stack.
