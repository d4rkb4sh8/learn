 The `fdisk` command in Linux is a standard tool for partitioning disks. It allows you to view, create, and delete partitions on a hard drive or other storage devices. Below are some key features of the `fdisk` command along with examples:

### Key Features of fdisk Command

1. **View Partitions**: You can list all partitions on a disk.
2. **Add New Partition**: Create new partitions on a disk.
3. **Delete Partitions**: Remove existing partitions from a disk.
4. **Modify Partitions**: Change the size or type of an existing partition.
5. **Save Changes**: Save changes made to the partition table to disk.

### Examples

#### 1. Viewing Partitions
To view the current partitions on your disk, you can use:
```bash
sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda
```
This will list all partitions on `/dev/sda`.

#### 2. Adding a New Partition
To add a new partition, you would typically follow these steps:
1. Create a new empty partition table (this will erase all data on the disk):
   ```bash
   sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
   ```
2. In the `fdisk` prompt, type `n` to create a new partition. Follow the prompts to set the starting sector and size of the new partition.
3. Save the changes with `w`.

#### 3. Deleting a Partition
To delete an existing partition:
1. Start `fdisk`:
   ```bash
   sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
   ```
2. Select the partition you want to delete (use `d` followed by the partition number).
3. Save the changes with `w`.

#### 4. Modifying a Partition
To modify an existing partition:
1. Start `fdisk`:
   ```bash
   sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
   ```
2. Select the partition you want to modify (use `p` or `n` to list all partitions, then select one).
3. Use commands like `d` to delete a partition, `n` to create a new partition, and so on.
4. Save the changes with `w`.

### Interactive Mode
The default behavior of `fdisk` is interactive. Once you start it, you will be prompted for each action:
1. Type `p` to print the current partition table.
2. Type `n` to create a new partition.
3. Follow the prompts to set the size and type of the new partition.
4. After setting up your partitions, type `w` to write the changes to disk.

### Common Commands in fdisk
- **p**: Print the partition table.
- **n**: Create a new partition.
- **d**: Delete a partition.
- **t**: Change the system ID of a partition (useful for changing file systems).
- **w**: Write the changes to disk and exit.
- **q**: Quit without saving changes.

### Example Scenario
Suppose you want to add a new primary partition on `/dev/sdb`:
1. Open `fdisk` with:
   ```bash
   sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
   ```
2. Type `n` and press Enter.
3. Select the default (primary) partition (`p`) or any other type if you know what you're doing, then press Enter.
4. Set the first sector as default by pressing Enter.
5. Set the last sector to cover the entire disk (or specify a size).
6. Type `t` and then enter the new file system type code for your partition (e.g., 83 for Linux filesystem).
7. Save changes with `w`.

This is a basic overview of using the `fdisk` command to manage partitions on a Linux system. For more detailed help, you can always access the manual page by typing:
```bash
man fdisk
