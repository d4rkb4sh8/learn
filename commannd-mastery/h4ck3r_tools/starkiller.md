 The Starkiller tool, previously known as Ettercap-Graphical, is a graphical user interface (GUI) for the popular network sniffer and man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack tool Ettercap. It provides an easy-to-use interface to perform various networking tasks such as ARP poisoning, session hijacking, and more.

Below are some of the features of Starkiller along with examples:

### 1. Interface Overview
Starkiller presents a user-friendly GUI that allows you to configure attacks visually. It provides an overview of your network interface, target machines, and active sessions.

**Example:**
Open Starkiller by typing `starkiller` in the Kali Linux terminal and observe the graphical interface showing available networks and targets.

### 2. Network Scanning
Starkiller can scan for hosts on a local network using ARP requests or DNS queries, providing information about connected devices.

**Example:**
- Start a network scan by going to the "Scan" tab in Starkiller and clicking "Start Scan." Select the appropriate network interface and click "Scan."

### 3. Target Selection
You can specify targets for your attacks using the IP addresses or hostnames of the machines you want to target.

**Example:**
- In the "Targets" tab, add a new target by entering an IP address or hostname and clicking "Add." Select multiple targets if needed.

### 4. ARP Poisoning
Starkiller allows you to perform ARP poisoning attacks, which can be useful for man-in-the-middle attacks or to capture credentials.

**Example:**
- In the "Attack" tab, select "ARP Poisoning." Configure the target IP addresses and click "Start Attack." You will see ARP responses being sent to all devices on the network.

### 5. Session Hijacking
Starkiller supports session hijacking attacks, allowing you to capture user sessions over HTTP/HTTPS.

**Example:**
- In the "Attack" tab, select "Session Hijacking." Configure the target IP addresses and click "Start Attack." Monitor active sessions for potential password sniffing or other sensitive information.

### 6. Built-in Scripts
Starkiller includes several built-in scripts to automate common tasks such as DNS spoofing, HTTP/HTTPS MITM attacks, and more.

**Example:**
- In the "Scripts" tab, select a script like "DNS Spoof" or "HTTP Poison." Configure the parameters and click "Start Script."

### 7. Statistics and Logs
Starkiller provides real-time statistics about active sessions, packet captures, and attack performance.

**Example:**
- Check the "Statistics" tab to see live data such as ARP table changes, session logs, and more.

### 8. User Interface Customization
You can customize the Starkiller interface with different themes and layouts to suit your preferences.

**Example:**
- Go to the "Options" menu and select a theme or configure advanced settings for customizing the look and feel of the interface.

### 9. Integration with Ettercap
Starkiller is built on top of Ettercap, so it inherits all its features and can be used as a front-end to manage and perform attacks via Ettercap's command line interface (CLI).

**Example:**
- You can switch to the CLI by going to "Options" -> "Switch to CLI." This allows you to use advanced Ettercap commands directly from Starkiller.

### 10. Saving and Loading Sessions
Starkiller allows you to save your current configuration and attack state, as well as load previously saved sessions for further analysis or continuation of an attack.

**Example:**
- Save a session by going to "File" -> "Save Session." Load a session by selecting the saved file in the "File" menu.

### Conclusion
Starkiller provides a user-friendly GUI for Ettercap, making it easier to perform network attacks and manage targets without having to use the command line directly. By using the features mentioned above, you can effectively utilize Starkiller to conduct various types of network attacks in a graphical environment.
