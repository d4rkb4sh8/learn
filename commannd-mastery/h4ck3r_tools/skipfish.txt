 SkipFish is a network connection testing and crawling tool that can help you identify potential vulnerabilities in web applications. It operates by sending different types of requests to the target server, including GET, POST, HEAD, cookie-based attacks, and more, to discover hidden resources and forms. Below are some key features and examples of how to use SkipFish in a Kali Linux terminal:

### Key Features
1. **Crawling and Scanning:** SkipFish crawls through the target website by following discovered links. It can identify potential vulnerabilities such as missing anti-CSRF tokens, weak or default passwords, and more.
2. **Request Types:** Supports various request types including GET, POST, HEAD, cookies, referer, user-agent spoofing, etc., to simulate different kinds of attacks.
3. **Form Analysis:** Identifies forms on the web pages and can submit data through these forms. It checks for CSRF vulnerabilities by submitting form data without a valid session token.
4. **External Resources:** Checks for external resources like images, JavaScript files, stylesheets, etc., that are potentially vulnerable or could be leveraged in attacks.
5. **User-Friendly Output:** Provides detailed output with colored logs and reports to make it easy to understand the results.
6. **Integration with Kali Linux:** Being part of the Kali Linux toolkit makes it accessible and ready for use right after installation.

### Basic Usage Examples
To run SkipFish, you would typically specify a target URL or IP address. Hereâ€™s how you can do that:

1. **Basic Scan:**
   ```bash
   skipfish -o output_filename -w wordlist.txt http://example.com
   ```
   This command tells SkipFish to scan `http://example.com` using the wordlist stored in `wordlist.txt`, and save the results in `output_filename`.

2. **Scan with Specific Options:**
   ```bash
   skipfish -o output_filename -w wordlist.txt --ssl-cert fake.crt http://example.com
   ```
   This command includes an option to use a fake SSL certificate (`--ssl-cert fake.crt`), which is useful for testing HTTPS configurations.

3. **Scan with Custom Headers:**
   ```bash
   skipfish -o output_filename -w wordlist.txt --header "X-Custom: Test" http://example.com
   ```
   This command adds a custom header `X-Custom: Test` to the requests sent by SkipFish.

4. **Using Specific Port:**
   ```bash
   skipfish -o output_filename -w wordlist.txt -p 8080 http://example.com:8080
   ```
   This command specifies that the scan should be performed on port `8080` of the target server.

5. **Scan with Timeout:**
   ```bash
   skipfish -o output_filename -w wordlist.txt --timeout 30 http://example.com
   ```
   This command sets a timeout of 30 seconds for each request made by SkipFish.

### Post-Scan Analysis and Reporting
SkipFish generates detailed HTML reports that can be found in the current directory under filenames prefixed with `output_filename`. These reports include vulnerabilities identified, performance metrics, and more. You can open these reports in a web browser to review the results visually.

### Conclusion
SkipFish is a powerful tool for security testing of web applications, providing detailed insights into potential weaknesses and helping you understand how robust your web infrastructure might be against various attacks. By using Kali Linux, you have immediate access to this valuable asset, equipped with comprehensive documentation and community support.
